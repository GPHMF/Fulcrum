Research demonstrates that organizational-level interventions are more effective than individual coping strategies in reducing burnout and improving retention. A 2024 systematic review in The Lancet found that organization-directed interventions targeting healthcare professionals yield 30-40% greater reductions in burnout compared to individual-focused programs.</p><p class=\"key-insight\">Leadership commitment and systemic change are essential. Individual resilience programs cannot compensate for toxic work environments or unsustainable workloads. This guide provides evidence-based strategies across eight critical domains.</p></div>",
