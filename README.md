## Healthcare's Pivot Point

**Live Site:** [[**https://gphmf.github.io/Fulcrum**](https://gphmf.github.io/Fulcrum)](https://gphmf.github.io/Fulcrum)

---

### Why Fulcrum?

The name "Fulcrum" represents healthcare providers as the pivot point of the entire healthcare system. When they're supported and well, everyone benefits. With 63% of physicians reporting burnout and physician suicide rates 2x higher than the general population, this platform provides the evidence-based resources providers need to maintain their own wellness while caring for others.

---

### About The Project

Fulcrum is a comprehensive, evidence-based wellness resource center built for healthcare providers. In an industry facing a burnout epidemic, this site provides targeted strategies, professional resources, and critical support for 8 distinct healthcare roles.

The entire application is a fast, responsive, and fully accessible Single Page Application (SPA) built with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript—no frameworks, no build process, just clean, maintainable code.

    * Physicians
    * Residents & Medical Students
    * Nurse Practitioners
    * Physician Assistants
    * Nurses
    * Pharmacists
    * Therapists (PT, OT, RT)

* **Data-Driven:** All content is loaded from a single `data.json` file, making it incredibly easy to maintain and update without touching the application code.
